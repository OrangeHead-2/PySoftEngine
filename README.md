# PySoftEngine

**PySoftEngine** is a highly extensible, zero‑dependency Python graphics engine and educational toolkit. It delivers a complete 2D/3D rendering and simulation pipeline—covering raw rasterization, shader scripting, animation, physics, GUI and terminal visualization, and browser demos via WebAssembly—all implemented in pure Python.

---

## Key Features

* **Shader Pipeline**: Modular vertex and fragment shaders defined as Python callables. Supports Lambert, Phong, Toon, and custom lighting models.
* **Scene Scripting**: Flexible scene graph with nodes and hierarchical transforms. Easy-to-use DSL for programmatic scene construction.
* **Animation Engine**: Keyframe interpolation, skeletal transforms, threaded playback, and real-time scene updates.
* **Physics Engine**: Real-time rigid-body simulation with bounding-box collision, mass/force integration, gravity, and threading support.
* **GUI Tool "RasterLab"**: Tkinter-based interactive canvas for visualizing rasterization stages, displaying wireframe vs. filled geometry, depth buffer, and debug overlays.
* **Terminal ASCII Renderer**: High-fidelity ASCII art output with Z-buffered shading, dithering, and live camera controls.
* **WebAssembly & PyScript Ready**: Preconfigured hooks for running engines in-browser via Pyodide or WebAssembly.
* **Educational Mode**: Step-by-step breakdown of each rendering stage—matrix math, culling, clipping, rasterization, and depth testing—with interactive inspection.
* **Plug-in System**: Easily extend with custom shaders, mesh loaders, and exporters (e.g., PNG, STL, GIF).
* **Multithreaded Rasterization**: Parallel triangle processing and threaded physics/animation for high performance on multi-core CPUs.

## Quick Start

1. **Requirements:** Python 3.8+ (no external packages)
2. **Install** (from project root):

   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```
3. **Run the GUI Visualizer:**

   ```bash
   pysoftraster gui
   ```
4. **Render ASCII in Terminal:**

   ```bash
   pysoftraster ascii --input scene.obj
   ```
5. **Compile for WebAssembly (demo):**

   ```bash
   pysoftraster wasm
   ```
6. **Programmatic Rendering:**

   ```python
   from pysoftraster.engine.scripting import Scene
   from pysoftraster.engine.shaders import PhongShader
   from pysoftraster.scene import Mesh, Light, Camera

   scene = Scene()
   scene.add_node(Mesh.cube(), name='cube')
   scene.add_light(Light.sun(direction=(1, -1, 0)))
   scene.set_camera(Camera(position=(0, 2, -5), look_at=(0, 0, 0)))
   scene.shader = PhongShader()
   scene.render('output.ppm')
   ```

## Educational Features

* **Pipeline Visualization:** Scrub through stages: vertex transform, back-face culling, clipping, rasterization, depth testing.
* **Matrix & Buffer Inspection:** Inspect intermediate data structures at runtime.
* **Live Mode:** Switch between ASCII, Tkinter GUI, or raw image output.
